# wildfly-hive

Proof of concept plugin to automatically create WildFly Swarm servers, start/stop them in Eclipse WTP.

This was inspired by the https://spring.io/blog/2015/10/08/the-spring-boot-dashboard-in-sts-part-1-local-boot-apps[Spring Boot Dashboard in STS].
But instead of coming up with a new view, the existing Servers view from Eclipse WTP is used.
