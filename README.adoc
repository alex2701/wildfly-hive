Proof of concept plugin to automatically create WildFly Swarm servers, start/stop them in Eclipse WTP.

This was inspired by the https://spring.io/blog/2015/10/08/the-spring-boot-dashboard-in-sts-part-1-local-boot-apps[Spring Boot Dashboard in STS].
But instead of coming up with a new view, the existing Servers view from Eclipse WTP is used.

The PoC can be installed in Eclipse from this p2 repository : https://dl.bintray.com/fbricon/poc/wildfly-hive/latest/

It requires Eclipse WTP, m2e, JBoss Tools Server Tools to run.

- Import a WildFly Swarm-based project
- Open the servers view, a new WildFly Swarm server should have been added
- Select the WildFly Swarm server and click start or debug
- profit

When started in debug mode, https://github.com/fakereplace/fakereplace[fakereplace] is launched to allow hot code replacement of changed classes, without restarting the JVM. 

Since it's a PoC, it's lacking a huge amount of features to make it really usable, like being able to configure the server launch configuration, proper port offset, configuration read from pom.xml, run multiple instances of the same server, make the swarm detection more reliable and so on. But it's EPL, so feel free to fork, hack and PR away.
